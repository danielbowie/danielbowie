# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Bowie

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on neuroimaging and biomarker modeling in aging and Alzheimer's disease. I specialize in statistical analysis using R and Python, with a strong interest in data science, reproducibility, and impactful research translation.

I'm currently transitioning from academia to industry, where I hope to apply my analytical, coding, and scientific communication skills to solve real-world problems.

> 💡 **Portfolio Overview**  
> This GitHub portfolio features R and Python projects focused on biomarker modeling, neuroimaging, and statistical methods applied to aging and Alzheimer's disease. Projects include work using ADNI and PREVENT-AD datasets, reproducible pipelines, and hybrid R–Python modeling via `reticulate`.

## Projects & Research Highlights

- **Sex-Related Differences in Cerebrovascular Health and Cognition**  
  Statistical modeling of cerebrovascular health and cognition using piecewise regression analysis.  
  📂 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danielbowie/neurovascular_aging_NBD) | 🔗 [OSF Link](https://osf.io/q3sxj/)

- **Amyloid-Negative / Tau-Positive Classification**  
Estimation of A−/T+ prevalence using bootstrapping, various PET classification methods (GMM, ROC, 2SD), and multimodal biomarker thresholds (PET, CSF, plasma).  
**Integrates R and Python via the `reticulate` package**, with Python-based GMM classification feeding into R-based statistical workflows.
Conducted using ADNI and PREVENT-AD data. While full datasets cannot be shared, ADNI data and some PREVENT-AD data are publicly available and the codebase is being developed as a transparent, reproducible pipeline.  
**_This project is ongoing and reflects an active line of research into atypical biomarker patterns in preclinical Alzheimer's disease._**

  📂 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danielbowie/amy_neg_tau_pos)

- **Cerebrovascular Health and Functional Connectivity**  
  Analysis of cerebrovascular health and functional network integrity during healthy aging. *(Finalizing work with PhD lab)*
  
- **Olfactory Function & AD Neuropathology**  
  Investigating associations between odor identification and in vivo AD neuropathology via PET. Also examining the influence of white matter microstructural health (DTI-derived fractional anisotropy) within tracts relevant to higher order olfactory processing.  
  *(Analysis based on PREVENT-AD data; results currently restricted by data access agreements.)*
