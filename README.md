# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel Bowie

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on neuroimaging and biomarker modeling in aging and Alzheimer's disease. I specialize in statistical analysis using R and Python, with a strong interest in data science, reproducibility, and impactful research translation.

I'm currently transitioning from academia to industry, where I hope to apply my analytical, coding, and scientific communication skills to solve real-world problems.

> ðŸ’¡ **Portfolio Overview**  
> This GitHub portfolio features R and Python projects focused on biomarker modeling, neuroimaging, and statistical methods applied to aging and Alzheimer's disease. Projects include work using ADNI and PREVENT-AD datasets, reproducible pipelines, and hybrid Râ€“Python modeling via `reticulate`.

## Projects & Research Highlights

- **Sex-Related Differences in Cerebrovascular Health and Cognition**  
  Statistical modeling of cerebrovascular health and cognition using piecewise regression analysis.  
  ðŸ“‚ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danielbowie/neurovascular_aging_NBD) | ðŸ”— [OSF Link](https://osf.io/q3sxj/)

- **Amyloid-Negative / Tau-Positive Classification**  
  Prevalence estimation using bootstrapping, Gaussian mixture models, and PET/CSF biomarker thresholds to explore Aâˆ’/T+ status and its long-term implications.
  **This project integrates R and Python using the `reticulate` package, with Python-based GMM modeling feeding into R-based statistical pipelines.**  
  *(Conducted using ADNI and PREVENT-AD data; due to data governance, code and results are not yet publicly shareable.)*
  
- **Cerebrovascular Health and Functional Connectivity**  
  Analysis of cerebrovascular health and functional network integrity during healthy aging. *(Finalizing work with PhD lab)*
  
- **Olfactory Function & White Matter Microstructure**  
  Investigating associations between odor identification and white matter integrity (DTI-derived fractional anisotropy) in tracts relevant to olfactory processing.  
  *(Analysis based on PREVENT-AD data; results currently restricted by data access agreements.)*
